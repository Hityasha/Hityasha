		<p> <strong>Earth </strong> is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object 
		known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other evidence, 
		Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space,
		especially the Sun and the Moon, which is Earth's only natural satellite. Earth orbits around 
		the Sun in 365.256 days, a period known as an Earth sidereal year. During this time,
		Earth rotates about its axis about 365.256 times.</p>

		<p><h3>Facts about earth</h3></p>
			<ol type="1">
				<li><strong>The Earth’s rotation is gradually slowing.</strong>
				This deceleration is happening almost imperceptibly, at approximately 17 milliseconds per hundred years,
				although the rate at which it occurs is not perfectly uniform. This has the effect of lengthening our days,
				but it happens so slowly that it could be as much as 140 million years before the length of a day will have increased to 25 hours.</li>
				<li><strong>The Earth was once believed to be the centre of the universe.</strong>
				Due to the apparent movements of the Sun and planets in relation to their viewpoint, ancient scientists insisted that 
				the Earth remained static, whilst other celestial bodies travelled in circular orbits around it. Eventually, the view 
				that the Sun was at the centre of the universe was postulated by Copernicus, though this is also not the case.</li>
				<li><strong>Earth has a powerful magnetic field.</strong>
				This phenomenon is caused by the nickel-iron core of the planet, coupled with its rapid rotation. 
				This field protects the Earth from the effects of solar wind.</li>
